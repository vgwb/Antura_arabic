Version 1.3.1 - 15 Augustus 2016
-------------

Core:
	- Optimisation: drastically decreased GC Alloc during BTs initialisation.

Fixes:
	- Fixed BT script field disappearing in the Inspector when BT script is invalid.
	- Fixed PandaBehaviour inspector not being updated when selecting BT script through the asset selector window.
	- Fixed null exception raised when adding PandaBehaviour component on prefabs.
	- Fixed Task.IsInspected being true while BT is not displayed in the Inspector.
	- Highlight unimplemented task in Inspector.
	- Fixed parsing error occuring when no EOL on last line.
	- Fixed BT scripts not being refreshed when reverted (Pro).

Minor Changes:
	- New icon for PandaBehaviour component and gizmo.
	- Added PandaBehaviour.xml for autocompletion documentation in IDE.



Version 1.3.0 - 2 June 2016
-------------
Core:
	- Added in-Inspector drag&drop editor (Pro Only).
	- Refactored tasks binding.

Fixes:
	- Fixed null exception occurring when a task is completed outside of its method (expl: from a callback).
	- Fixed mute node without child not raising exception.
	
Minor changes:
	- BT script fullpath is displayed in Exception message instead of file name only.
	- Modified break point UI.


Version 1.2.3 - 5 April 2016
-------------

Core:
	- Optimized for GC Allocations per frame (after initialization, 0B is allocated by the engine).
	- Added Task.isInspected, which returns whether the current BT script is displayed in the Inspector.
      (Use to avoid GC allocation when formatting string for debugInfo)
	- Added PandaBehaviour.Compile( string source ) and PandaBehaviour.Compile( string[] sources ),
	  which are used to make BTs from strings instead of TextAssets.
	- Added built-in task DebugBreak, which breaks (pauses the editor) and succeeds immediately.


Fixes:
	- Fixed BT being reset when object is selected in the Hierarchy.
	- Built-in task WaitAnyKeyDown had parameter, now removed.

Minor changes:
	- Simplified management of BT update and recompilation when scripts has been modified.
	

Version 1.2.2 - 13 March 2016
-------------

Changes:
	- Releasing Panda BT Pro containing the sources.
	- Break point is now a pro-only feature.
	- Added status dependent break point.
		You can setup different type of break points that will trigger when:
		 . The node is starting (blue break point),
		 . The node succeeds (green break point)
		 . The node fails (red break point)

Minor changes:
	- Only left click is used to navigate to task definition.
	- Left click toggles and cycles through break point type, right click clears break point.

	


Version 1.2.1 - 24 February 2016
-------------

Core:
	- Made some caching optimizations resulting in faster tree traversal.
	- RANDOM node is now based on UnityEngine.Random instead of System.Random.

Minor Changes:
	- The built-in task 'Wait' now display a countdown as debugInfo instead of elapsed time.
	- Improved comments of the examples.

Fixes:
	- Fixed break point and line number highlighting not working properly when using single line parenting.
	- Fixed checking for task definitions when component is added or removed from the GameObject.
	- Fixed parsing space indentations. BT scripts using spaces instead of tabulations for indentations was not parsed properly.


Version 1.2.0 - 10 February 2016
-------------
Package:
	- Simplified examples to reduce package size.

Debugging:	 
	- Improved error messages.
	- Highlighting errors in inspector.
	- Highlighting currently executing lines.
	- Opening task definitions in external script editor when double click on tasks in inspector.
	- Improved breakpoints debugging.

Core:
	- Modification of the WHILE node.
		The WHILE not was a duplication of the repeat not. Now the WHILE not does
		not repeat its child anymore. It runs its child while as long as the condition succeeds. 
		It succeeds when the child succeeds and fails when the condition or the child fails.
	- Removed IF node because conditionnal branching can be construct with SEQUENCE and FALLBACK.
	- Renamed [TaskMethod] to [Task].
	- Method returning bool, boolean field and boolean property can now be used from BT script with the [Task] attribute.
	- Random node now accepts integer as weight in the node parameters.
	- Improved RANDOM node weights computation and probability distribution.
	- Added more build-in tasks to PandaBehaviour
	- Using Task.current.Succeed(), Task.current.Fail() and Task.current.isStarting in task methods.
	- WHILE and IF nodes now succeed when their condition fails.
	- Allowed defining task as static method.
	- behaviour node is now named tree.
	- Root tree is now named "Root" instead of "Main".
	- Syntax changes: parenthesis and coma are now optionals for node parameters.
	- Improved Code Viewer appearance for better integration within Unity.

Fixes:
	- Fixed parsing comments.
	- Fixed null pointer error occuring when no BT script is assigned to a panda Behaviour.
	- Fixed Panda Behaviour not being initialized when disable on game start.
	- Fixed parser error sometimes occures when several BT scripts is assigned to one Panda Behaviour.
	- Fixed parsing negative float or negative int in node parameters.
	- Fixed public method not being bound.
	- Fixed parenting error with task nodes.

	
Minor changes:
	- It's not more possible to set break points on line not containing nodes.	


Version 1.0.1 - 12 Mai 2015
--------------
	- Wrapped example scripts under Panda.Demo namespace to avoid name collision during package import.
	- Fixed subtree not being reset when called more than once.
	- Concurrent running of subtree is not allowed. An exception is now raised when that happen.
		This might occures when the subtree is a children of PARALLEL or RACE node.
	- Wait Task: display Debug info string for wait when the node is completed
	- Clear debugInfo string when the node is reset.


Version 1.0.0 - 23 Mars 2015

	First release
